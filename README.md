# FavTabs
Script for opening all favorite websites at once.

# Instructions
1. Download the folder.
2. Edit the Bookmarks.txt file to your liking; put each URL on a new line.
3. Run the program as you would a normal python script.  For convenience, I recommend using a program like Platypus- that way, you can run the program with one click.
